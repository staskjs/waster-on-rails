# WASTER

[waster.info](http://waster.info)

Reimplementation of time tracker app to Ruby on Rails.

It is an app that helps to track your time spent on anything, mostly on work.

You can define amount of hours that you should spend on desired activity (e.g. 40
hours of work) during some time interval (e.g. a week). Then you just click start
and then click finish.

## TODO

* About page

* Ability to connect multiple Oauth providers to a single account

* Ability to use multiple timers for different purposes
